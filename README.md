The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine’s operating system and apps. The CPU interprets, processes and executes instructions, most often from the hardware and software programs running on the device.

The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data input into more usable information output. While the CPU must contain at least one processing core, many contain multiple cores. A server with two hexa-core CPUs, for example, will have a total of 12 processors.
### -DPU (Data Processing Unit)  
DPU is tasked with offloading and managing networking, security, and storage functions that traditionally burden the central processing unit (CPU). By assuming these specific roles, DPUs significantly alleviate the workload of CPUs, thereby augmenting their capacity for general-purpose computing tasks.
### -GPU (Graphic Processing Unit)
A graphics processing unit, also known as a graphical processing unit or GPU, is an electronic circuit designed to speed computer graphics and image processing on a variety of devices, including video cards, motherboards, mobile phones and personal computers (PCs).

By performing mathematical calculations rapidly, a GPU reduces the amount of time needed for a computer to run multiple programs, making it an essential enabler of emerging and future technologies like machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain
### -TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
A Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a specialized hardware accelerator designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning tasks. It excels in operations common to neural networks, such as matrix multiplications, offering enhanced performance and efficiency compared to traditional CPUs and GPUs
## COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
Computer architecture refers to the end-to-end structure of a computer system that determines how its components interact with each other in helping to execute the machine’s purpose (i.e., processing data), often avoiding any reference to the actual technical implementation.

## Types of computer architecture
### CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
##### Definition
CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer, and it's a processor design that uses complex instructions to perform multiple operations in a single instruction. 
 
#### Features
CISC architectures are designed to: 
 
Avoid expensive memory 
 
Move complex instructions to the hardware level 
 
Perform algorithms in fewer instructions than RISC architectures

### AISC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)
An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is custom-designed for a specific application or task, rather than being a general-purpose chip like a microprocessor or memory chip. ASICs are tailored to perform specific operations efficiently and are often used in devices where performance, power consumption, and space are critical factors.

#### Examples of devices that use ASICs include:

###### Smartphones: ASICs are used in mobile processors to optimize performance and battery life.

###### Cryptocurrency Mining: Specialized ASICs are used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as they are more efficient than general-purpose CPUs or GPUs.

###### Networking Equipment: ASICs are used in routers and switches to manage data flow efficiently.


Because ASICs are custom-built for specific tasks, they can be faster and more energy-efficient than general-purpose chips, but they are also more expensive and time-consuming to develop.
### SoC (System on a Chip)
A System on a Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that consolidates all the components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. This includes essential components like the central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, input/output (I/O) controllers, and other necessary functions for the system to operate.
The advantage of SoCs is that they provide a high degree of functionality in a small footprint, which is crucial for mobile and embedded applications. They are also optimized for specific tasks, making them more efficient in terms of power and performance than systems using multiple discrete chips.
## RAM (random access memory)
RAM, or random access memory, is a computer's short-term memory that stores data the processor needs to run applications and open files. RAM is a critical component of a computer that works with the central processing unit (CPU) to quickly access information.

Speed: RAM is faster than disks at reading and writing information. 
 
Capacity: RAM is measured in bytes, and can range from 4 GB to 32 GB or more. 
 
Performance: The more RAM a device has, the better its performance will be. This is because RAM allows the processor to quickly find the information it needs, without having to go into long-term storage. 
 
Multitasking: RAM is important for multitasking, as it allows the computer to store and access large amounts of data quickly. 
 
Startup times: RAM allows applications to start up faster, which reduces loading times. 
 
Adding RAM: Computers typically come with at least two RAM modules, but more can be added if needed.
## ROM (Read-Only Memory)
Read-Only Memory (ROM) is a type of computer memory that stores permanent data and instructions that are essential for a computer to start up and run: 
 
What it is:

ROM is a non-volatile memory that stores data that cannot be written over or erased. It retains its contents even when the power is off. 
 
What it does
ROM contains the instructions needed for a computer to boot up, perform large input/output (I/O) tasks, and protect programs or software instructions. 
 
How it's used
ROM is used in almost every computer, video game consoles, optical storage, calculators, and peripheral devices. 
 
Types
The types of ROM include PROM (programmable read-only memory) and EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory).
