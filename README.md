## What is Computer Science and Why is it so Important? 
Computer science is the process of solving complex organizational problems using technical solutions.

The reason this is such an important field is that computers and technology have been integrated into virtually every economic sector, industry, and even organization operating in the modern economy.

Professionals working in computer science roles are responsible for some of the most important tasks needed to keep businesses running, including:

Analyzing the impact of computers and computing on individuals, organizations, and society.
Designing, building, maintaining, and updating software systems of varying complexity.
Building, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems and processes.
Leveraging technical solutions to solve complicated problems.
Everywhere you look, you’ll find computers and other technological systems or devices powering business decisions and operations.

It’s virtually impossible to run a modern business without utilizing computer-driven technology, which is just one of the many reasons why people consider computer science to be so important.
