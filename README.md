## What is Computer Science and Why is it so Important? 
Computer science is the process of solving complex organizational problems using technical solutions.

The reason this is such an important field is that computers and technology have been integrated into virtually every economic sector, industry, and even organization operating in the modern economy.

Professionals working in computer science roles are responsible for some of the most important tasks needed to keep businesses running, including:

Analyzing the impact of computers and computing on individuals, organizations, and society.
Designing, building, maintaining, and updating software systems of varying complexity.
Building, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems and processes.
Leveraging technical solutions to solve complicated problems.
Everywhere you look, you’ll find computers and other technological systems or devices powering business decisions and operations.

It’s virtually impossible to run a modern business without utilizing computer-driven technology, which is just one of the many reasons why people consider computer science to be so important.
## COMPUTATION       
A computation is an operation that begins with some initial conditions and gives an output which follows from a definite set of rules. The most common example are computations performed by computers, in which the fixed set of rules may be the functions provided by a particular programming language.
### -CPU (Central Processing Unit)                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine’s operating system and apps. The CPU interprets, processes and executes instructions, most often from the hardware and software programs running on the device.

The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data input into more usable information output. While the CPU must contain at least one processing core, many contain multiple cores. A server with two hexa-core CPUs, for example, will have a total of 12 processors.
### -DPU (Data Processing Unit)  
DPU is tasked with offloading and managing networking, security, and storage functions that traditionally burden the central processing unit (CPU). By assuming these specific roles, DPUs significantly alleviate the workload of CPUs, thereby augmenting their capacity for general-purpose computing tasks.
### -GPU (Graphic Processing Unit)
A graphics processing unit, also known as a graphical processing unit or GPU, is an electronic circuit designed to speed computer graphics and image processing on a variety of devices, including video cards, motherboards, mobile phones and personal computers (PCs).

By performing mathematical calculations rapidly, a GPU reduces the amount of time needed for a computer to run multiple programs, making it an essential enabler of emerging and future technologies like machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain
### -TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
A Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a specialized hardware accelerator designed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning tasks. It excels in operations common to neural networks, such as matrix multiplications, offering enhanced performance and efficiency compared to traditional CPUs and GPUs
